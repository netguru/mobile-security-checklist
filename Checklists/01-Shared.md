# Shared security requirements between platforms

## Default

| ID  | Priority | Feature | Description | Link |
| --  | -- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | - |
| SD.1 | High | Login / Signup, keeping user session alive | All tokens / credentials must be stored in keychain/keystore if they are persisted | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.2 | High | Storing environment variables | Environment variables cannot be stored in github repository. All envs should be stored in secrets on CI (e. g. Bitrise) | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.3 | Medium | App is using logs. | No sensitive data is written to application logs. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.4 | Critical |  Sensitive aplication logic | Validate every update of a sensitive value with the server. <br> Do not validate sensitive features locally <br> For example: <br> - Admin mode <br> - Coins for premium features | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.5 | Critical | Hardcoded keys | App doesn't store sensitive hardcoded keys inside app and conforms to best practices of storing hardcoded keys. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.6 | Critical | Login / signup | Do not store user password in local data storage. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.7 | High | Third party service with API keys. | Keys generated in Third Party service like Google Cloud should have minimum set of permissions. <br> It should have assigned bundleID / AppID to key, It will accept data only from those apps. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.8 | Medium | Authentication requires to enter data (password, pin) through e.g. keyboard. | No sensitive data, such as passwords or pins, is exposed through the user interface. You have to use secure text entry for fields. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.9 | Critical | App is making requests to REST API. | Whole communication should use only HTTPS protocol. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.10 | Medium | Platforms with native obfuscation: Android, Flutter, React-Native. | Obfuscation should be configured. For Android: App should have proguard/r8 enabled. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.11 | Low | App is adding new permissions. | Review permissions and use only necessary. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.12 | High | App has apple certificates, google keystore or other sensitive files. | Secure them in proper place and describe how it's achieved. E.g. make sure they are all stored only in 1pass and access has minimal amount of people. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.13 | High | App is persisting data. App saves files. | No sensitive data is included in backups generated by the mobile operating system. Make sure that all files are saved in proper place. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.14 | Medium | User can recover account. | The app doesn't rely on a single insecure communication channel (email or SMS) for critical operations, such as enrollments and account recovery. You should have possiblity to verify somehow user identity e.g. security questions, additional informtation about what happend in account. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.15 | Medium | Login / signup | Removing all data after logout, keychain, files, cache. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.16 | Low | User enter sensitive data or password into inputs. | Disable additional hardware keyboard connected to device, user can only use fabric one. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
| SD.17 | High | Logout. | Invalidate access token through request to backend. | [Handbook](../Handbooks/TODO.md) |
