# Requirement
## [CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)
App doesn't store sensitive hardcoded keys inside app and conforms to best practices of storing hardcoded keys.

## Introduction

Mobile applications are often viewed as safe storage by some developers.

When you look at an applicationâ€™s compiled code, it seems that it's not readable and no hard-coded values can be found. However, an experienced and motivated pentester will find it really easy to extract such keys and even automate the process of extracting hard-coded values. That's why you should never store or hard-code sensitive keys inside your app.

The problem of considering compiled mobile applications as safe storage is real. [This article claims](https://bevigil.com/blog/mobile-apps-exposing-aws-keys-affect-100m-users-data/) that 0.5% of mobile applications contain AWS API keys which has resulted in the exposure of 100M+ users. That number is for sure bigger than 0.5%, as in this article they only consider AWS API keys. There are much more sensitive keys that should not be stored directly in code and you can find a lot of articles describing such cases. There are also [CWE issues](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html) describing the subject.
