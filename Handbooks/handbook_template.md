# Requirement
## [Link to requirement specification (OWASP MSTG, CWE, etc)](https://)
<!-- Short description of the requirement. -->

## Risk
<!--
Risk explanation of the feature not being implemented properly in the project.
This should provide information that will persuade non-tech product owners
to invest into improving the security of the project.
-->

## When you need it
<!--
List of factors that help to decide if your
project needs this security requirement to be implemented.
This can include things like application target,
vulnerable logic flows or specific features.
-->

## Problem and desired effect
### Problem:
<!-- Initial state of the project without secure implementation. (AS IS) -->

### Desired effect:
<!-- Desired state of the project with proper security measures. (TO BE) -->

## Solution
<!--
Proposed solution.
Depending on a requirement this can be a description of general improvements
or even detailed implementation steps with code examples.
This section should provide guidance for developers
of each major platform (Android, iOS, React Native or Flutter).
-->

## Testing guide
### Description
<!--
Brief description of desired effect.
(how application should behave with proper implementation)
-->

### Example scenario:
<!--
Example scenario describing how application
should behave with proper implementation.
-->

### Tools needed:
<!-- List of tools required to perform test of the implementation. -->

### How to:
<!--
Step by step guide with instructions how to perform an 'attack'
that will test if everything was properly implemented.
-->
